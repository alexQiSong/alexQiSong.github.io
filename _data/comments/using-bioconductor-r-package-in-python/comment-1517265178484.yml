message: "R has built-in `suppressMessages`, `suppressWarnings`, and `suppressPackageStartupMessages` functions you would wrap your function calls/library load around to suppress messages.\r\n\r\nI usually end up dealing with the messages because it's weird having to wrap what I want to do around those functions."
