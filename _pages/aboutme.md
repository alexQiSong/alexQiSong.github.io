## So what is Qinomics?
Qinomics is the personal website for Alex Qi Song. His research focuses on developing computational tools to study genomic and transcriptomic data. Therefore you might consider Qinomics as Qi's genomic study (Please tell him if you have other interpretation for the name. :-)). Qinomics is pronouced as Chee-nomics. My first name 'Qi' is derived from Chinese word Qilin (麒麟), which represents the mythical creature in ancient Chinese mythology.

## Alex Qi Song's Experience
I am currently a Phd student enrolled in GBCB (Genetics, Bioinformatics and Compuational Biology) program at Virginia Tech. I work as graduate research assistant in Dr. Song Li's lab. My research focuses on applying machine learning and data mining in the study of transcriptional regulation for plant species.  
Before joining Virginia Tech, I completed my master degree of Bioinformatics at Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, where I worked as research and teaching assistant in Dr. Huaqin He's lab. The research topic was prediction of protein-protein interaction between host and pathogen.  
From 2008 to 2012, I was an undergraduate student majoring in Biological Sciences at Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (福建农林大学).  
Before joining the college, I completed my high school at The Senior School Of Nanping (南平高级中学)

## Alex Qi Song's Hobby
In my spare time, I like to do a lot of things, including gym work out, sketching, graphic design, coding, playing video games, cooking whatever I can cook ... I made a logo for my phd program for fun, albeit not an official one. ;-P
