## ConSReg

![](/assets/images/consreg_flowchart.png)
**ConSReg** stands for "**Con**dition **S**pecific **Reg**ulatory network inference engine". ConSReg was designed to infer gene regulations using integrated heterogeneous genomic data (DAP-seq, ATAC-seq and single cell/bulk RNA-seq). ConSReg prioritizes key regulatory genes by using machine learning based regularization and stability selection (currently under review). ConSReg Python package is available at: https://github.com/LiLabAtVT/ConSReg

## CoReg

CoReg is a computational tool for identifying co-regulatory genes in large-scale networks. CoReg is provided as an R package, which can be applied in any organisms with genome-scale regulatory network data.  You can find CoReg in my [github repository]( https://github.com/alexQiSong/CoReg) The paper was recently published in [BMC Systems Biology]( https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12918-017-0493-2). CoReg R package is available at: https://github.com/LiLabAtVT/CoReg

## transEval

transEval is a computational tool for evaluating de novo transcriptome assembly result. This tool is currently under development and will be released soon.
