## CoReg

CoReg is a computational tool for identifying co-regulatory genes in large-scale networks. CoReg is provided as an R package, which can be applied in any organisms with genome-scale regulatory network data.  You can find CoReg in my [github repository]( https://github.com/alexQiSong/CoReg) The paper was recently published in [BMC Systems Biology]( https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12918-017-0493-2)

## transEval

transEval is a computational tool for evaluating de novo transcriptome assembly result. This tool is currently under development and will be released soon

## RegNet

RegNet is a web-based platform for integrative analysis of transcriptional regulations for plant species. User can query and visualize abiotic stress related regulatory interactions for plants. I am currently working on machine learning based regulatory interaction inference for this platform and this feature will be added to the platform once I finish the modelling work.
